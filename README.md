**Explanation of project functionality:**
When first loading the web application you are sent to a Login/ Create Account page. Here you can either login with my current code and password (Username:Jgarcia, Password:1234) or create your personal account, which upon creating will have a 3 second time limit before sending you to the login screen.
After logging in you can see a “Welcome to Main Page , (your username)” alongside multiple tabs that you are prompted to click. These tabs include:
•	**Profile** - a page where you can view your username and allow you to update your email and phone number. As well as take and update notes that will save to the database. 
•	**Exploring Psychic Abilities** - 8 dropdown tabs that include the psychic abilities and upon hovering on them will provide an explanation and how to recognize it. 
•	**Fundamentals and Components** – this page will prompt you to click on 3 different drop-down buttons that will provide information about each tab and similar. 
•	**Basic Spells** – this is a page where it gives a simple quick spell from my opinion but also provides a picture that could be clicked to see similar spells someone else recommended.
•	**Logout** - this will log you out and send you back to the login page.
